Nodes to move the jbot and estimate its state.

* jbot_autonomy -- take in operator commands and the current environment, and send motion commands. uses Behavior Trees.
* motion_control -- simple PID controller that takes in desired Twist and actual Twist and sends commands to the motor node
* state_estimate -- use differential drive model to estimate the robot's state
